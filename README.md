If for whatever reason you need this:

1. `you@acomputer:~$ git clone https://github.com/canadaj/pi-dashboard`
2. `you@acomputer:~$ cd pi-dashboard`
3. `you@acomputer:~$ npm install`
4. `you@acomputer:~$ node server.js`
5. Pop the champagne
6. Realize something is totally wrong and make some pull requests
7. Actually, this is beyond saving, better fork it and just go from there
8. This had better be worth it
9. ...does the world even need this?
10. `rm -rf pi-dashboard/`
